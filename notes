salary cap: 60000

The csv has a list of players and there cost.

My goal is to be able to visualize multiple player rosters.

For example something with the data below.

Available players    roster1,                   roster2, roster3
player1 cost123       QB,rb,rb,wr,wr,wr,te,K,def


Thinking about making a react app for this?

Gulp, flux and redux?
