salary cap: 60000

The csv has a list of players and there cost.

My goal is to be able to visualize multiple player rosters.

For example something with the data below.

Tabs week1/week2/week3
Available players    roster1,                   roster2, roster3
player1 cost123       QB,rb,rb,wr,wr,wr,te,K,def


next steps
backend to store data.

Thinking about making a react app for this?

Gulp, webpack, flux and redux

getting started
npm init


Actions
  interactions with React Components
  fetching data sync or async (api calls)

Components
  Dumb React Components which work similarly irrespective of parents

containers
  React Components which have access to state

Reducers
  Functions which
    f(action,prev_state)=>next_state

Middlewares
  Functions which can perform instructions when actions are fired

Store
  Redux state is stored here
